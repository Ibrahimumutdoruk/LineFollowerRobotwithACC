   *This study presents the design and implementation of a line-following robot with PID-based adaptive cruise control, built using the STM32F103RB Nucleo microcontroller. The robot uses an infrared sensor array to detect and follow a predefined path by measuring voltage changes. An ultrasonic sensor is utilized for obstacle detection, enabling the robot to adjust its speed and position dynamically to maintain a safe distance. The PID controller processes data from the sensors to achieve accurate control, providing stable path following and effective obstacle management. Dual DC motors, managed through a motor driver circuit, provide smooth and responsive movement. The embedded software, developed at the register level, maximizes performance and hardware efficiency. Additionally, a user interface displays real-time information about the system's status, supporting reliable operation. This project demonstrates the effective application of PID control in achieving precise line following and obstacle avoidance within defined limits, showcasing efficient and stable robotic performance.*
